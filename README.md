This project analyzes the investment viability of domestic smartphone manufacturing in Pakistan under the Mobile Device Manufacturing Policy (MDMP). With the local market demand nearing 22â€“40 million phones annually and government incentives (0% duty on SKD/CKD kits, tax holidays), the report evaluates the profitability of setting up a local assembly plant compared to an import-based model.

Using financial modeling tools like Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period, along with real-world data and case studies (Infinix, Tecno, Samsung), we conclude that local manufacturing yields a higher NPV and IRR with a ~3-year payback. This repository includes the complete financial model, policy review, and strategic recommendations to guide investors and policymakers on fostering a sustainable smartphone manufacturing ecosystem in Pakistan.
